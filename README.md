# Weather-and-Climate-of-Utah

This project was a part of our graduate Visualization for Data Science course through the University of Utah. Our goal was to create an interactive visualization of the weather and climate in Utah.

### Collaborators

- Savanna Wolvin
- Michael Pletcher

## Weather-and-Climate-of-Utah Summary
The overarching objective of our project is to produce visualizations of the weather and climate in Utah. The benefit of these visualizations is communicating with non-atmospheric scientists climatological trends, how terrain may affect these trends, and the implications towards natural hazards and resources. The questions we plan to answer with these visualizations are:

- What is the climatological distribution of monthly average temperatures and precipitation totals at observation stations across Utah?
- Is there a climatological trend in precipitation and temperature at observation stations across Utah? Is there a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperatures?
- What is the climatological gradient of precipitation and temperature with elevation by month? How does it vary by season?
- Are there relationships between precipitation and temperature trends with natural resources and the occurrence of natural hazards?

A video description of the visualizations is linked [here](https://youtu.be/cW-xDsN0TH4).
